//    Yoda is starting his newly created Jedi academy. So, he asked master Ivan Cho to buy the needed equipment.
//    The number of items depends on how many students will sign up. The equipment for the Padawan contains lightsabers,
//    belts and robes.
//    You will be given the amount of money Ivan Cho has, the number of students and the prices of each item.
//    You have to help Ivan Cho calculate if the money he has is enough to buy all of the equipment,
//    or how much more money he needs.
//    Because the lightsabres sometimes brake, Ivan Cho should buy 10% more, rounded up to the next integer.
//    Also, every sixth belt is free.
