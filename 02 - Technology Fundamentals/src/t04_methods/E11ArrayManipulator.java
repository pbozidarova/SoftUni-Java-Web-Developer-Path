public class E11ArrayManipulator {
//    The array may be manipulated by one of the following commands
//            •	exchange {index} – splits the array after the given index, and exchanges the places of the two resulting sub-arrays. E.g. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> exchange 2 -> result: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
//    o	If the index is outside the boundaries of the array, print “Invalid index”
//            •	max even/odd– returns the INDEX of the max even/odd element -> [1, 4, 8, 2, 3] -> max odd -> print 4
//            •	min even/odd – returns the INDEX of the min even/odd element -> [1, 4, 8, 2, 3] -> min even > print 3
//    o	If there are two or more equal min/max elements, return the index of the rightmost one
//    o	If a min/max even/odd element cannot be found, print “No matches”
//            •	first {count} even/odd– returns the first {count} elements -> [1, 8, 2, 3] -> first 2 even -> print [8, 2]
//            •	last {count} even/odd – returns the last {count} elements -> [1, 8, 2, 3] -> last 2 odd -> print [1, 3]
//    o	If the count is greater than the array length, print “Invalid count”
//    o	If there are not enough elements to satisfy the count, print as many as you can. If there are zero even/odd elements, print an empty array “[]”
//            •	end – stop taking input and print the final state of the array
