// 5.	Auto-Engineering Company
// You are tasked to create a register for a company that produces cars. You need to store how many cars have been produced 
// from a specified model of a specified brand.
// Input
// The input comes as array of strings. Each element holds information in the following format:
// “{carBrand} | {carModel} | {producedCars}”
// The car brands and models are strings, the produced cars are numbers. If the car brand you’ve received already exists, 
// just add the new car model to it with the produced cars as its value. If even the car model exists, just add the given value 
// to the current one.
// Output
// As output you need to print - for every car brand, the car models, and number of cars produced from that model. 
// The output format is:
// “{carBrand}
//   ###{carModel} -> {producedCars}
//   ###{carModel2} -> {producedCars}
//   ...”
// The order of printing is the order in which the brands and models first appear in the input. The first brand in the 
// input should be the first printed and so on. For each brand, the first model received from that brand, should be the first printed and so on.
