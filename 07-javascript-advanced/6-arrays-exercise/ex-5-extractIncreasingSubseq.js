// 5.	Extract Increasing Subsequence from Array
// Write a function that extracts only those numbers that form a non-decreasing subsequence. 
// In other words, you start from the first element and continue to the end of the given array 
// of numbers. Any number which is LESS THAN the current biggest one is ignored, alternatively 
// if itâ€™s equal or higher than the current biggest one you set it as the current biggest 
// one and you continue to the next number. 
// The input comes as an array of numbers.
// The output is the processed array after the filtration, which should be a non-decreasing 
// subsequence. Each element should be printed on a new line.
