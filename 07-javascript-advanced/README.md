#### Syntax, Functions and Statements
## 1. JavaScript is a dynamic programming language
Intro: JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. 

- [x] Data Types - primitives and reference types;
- [x] Identifiers - identifiers are case-sensitive and can contain Unicode letters, $ _, and digits (0-9), but may not start with a digit

- [x] Operators - arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical operators, truthy and falsy values;
- [x] Functions - definition, declaration, types, parameters, first-class function, nested functions
- [x] Hoisting - variable and function declarations are put into memory during the compile phase, but stay exactly where you typed them in your code;
