// Write a function that implements a calculator that has the following functionalities:
// When one of the buttons is clicked, its value should be shown in the "Expression" field (#expressionOutput).
// For instance, if we click on the button with value 9.
// If the current Expression field (#expresisonOutput) contains the whole math expression (left operand, operator and right operand: 
// Example: 9 + 2), 
// When the equal sign "=" is pressed, the result of that expression should appear in the Result field (#resultOutput)
// Otherwise, if we create an invalid expression such as "99 +" (without second/right operand) and we hit the equal sign "="

// The "Clear" button should clear both Expression and Result fields (#expressionOutput and #resultOutput)
