// 8.	Diagonal Sums
// A square matrix of numbers comes as an array of strings, each string holding numbers (space separated). Write a function that finds the sum at the main and at the secondary diagonals.
// The input comes as array of arrays, containing number elements (2D matrix of numbers).
// The output is printed on the console, on a single line separated by space. First print the sum at the main diagonal, then the sum at the secondary diagonal.
