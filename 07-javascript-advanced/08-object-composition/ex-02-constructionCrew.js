// Write a program that receives a worker object as a parameter and modifies its properties. Workers have the following structure:
// { weight: Number,
//   experience: Number,
//   levelOfHydrated: Number,
//   dizziness: Boolean }
// Weight is expressed in kilograms, experience in years and levelOfHydrated is in milliliters. If you receive a worker whoâ€™s dizziness 
// property is set to true it means he needs to intake some water in order to be able to work correctly. The required amount is 0.1ml per 
// kilogram per year of experience. The required amount must be added to the existing amount. Once the water is administered, change the 
// dizziness property to false.
// Workers who do not have dizziness should not be modified in any way. Return them as they were.
