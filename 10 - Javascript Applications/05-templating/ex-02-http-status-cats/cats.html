<!-- 2.	HTTP Status Cats
We all love cats. They are also a fun way to learn all the HTTP status codes.
Your task is to refactor the given HTML and to create a template to represent each cat card block on it's own. After you have created 
the templete render it into the div with id "allCats".
A cat has an id, statusCode, statusMessage and imageLocation. The cats are seeded using the function from the js file named "catSeeder.js"
Each card block has a button that unveils status code information connected to each cat. You should toggle the button and change it's 
text from "Show status code" to "Hide status code". -->
