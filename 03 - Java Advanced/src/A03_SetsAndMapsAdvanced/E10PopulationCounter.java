//    So many people! It’s hard to count them all. But that’s your job as a statistician. You get raw data for a
//    given city and you need to aggregate it.
//    On each input line you’ll be given data in format: "city|country|population". There will be no redundant
//    whitespaces anywhere in the input. Aggregate the data by country and by city and print it on the console.
//    For each country, print its total population and on separate lines the data for each of its cities.
//    Countries should be ordered by their total population in descending order and within each country,
//    the cities should be ordered by the same criterion. If two countries/cities have the same population,
//    keep them in the order in which they were entered. Check out the examples; follow the output format strictly!
