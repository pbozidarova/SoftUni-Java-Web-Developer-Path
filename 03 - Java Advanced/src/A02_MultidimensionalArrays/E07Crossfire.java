public class E07Crossfire {
//    You will receive two integers which represent the dimensions of a matrix. Then, you must fill the matrix with
//    increasing integers starting from 1, and continuing on every row, like this:
//    first row: 1, 2, 3, …, n
//    second row: n + 1, n + 2, n + 3, …, n + n
//    third row: 2 * n + 1, 2 * n + 2, …, 2 * n + n

//    You will also receive several commands in the form of 3 integers separated by a space. Those 3 integers will
//    represent a row in the matrix, a column and a radius. You must then destroy the cells which correspond
//    to those arguments cross-like.

//    Destroying a cell means that, that cell becomes completely nonexistent in the matrix. Destroying cells cross-like
//    means that you form a cross figure with center point - equal to the cell with coordinates – the given row and
//    column, and lines with length equal to the given radius. See the examples for more info.
//    The input ends when you receive the command “Nuke it from orbit”. When that happens, you must print what has
//    remained from the initial matrix.
