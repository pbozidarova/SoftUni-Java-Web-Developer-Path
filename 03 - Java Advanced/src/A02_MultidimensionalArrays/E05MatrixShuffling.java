//    Write a program which reads a string matrix from the console and performs certain operations with its elements.
//    User input is provided in a similar way like in the problems above â€“ first you read the dimensions
//    and then the data.
//    Your program should then receive commands in format: "swap row1 col1 row2c col2" where row1, row2, col1, col2
//    are coordinates in the matrix. In order for a command to be valid, it should start with the "swap" keyword
//    along with four valid coordinates (no more, no less). You should swap the values at the given coordinates
//    (cell [row1, col1] with cell [row2, col2]) and print the matrix at each step (thus you'll be able to check
//    if the operation was performed correctly).

//    If the command is not valid (doesn't contain the keyword "swap", has fewer or more coordinates
//    entered or the given coordinates do not exist), print "Invalid input!" and move on to the next command.
//    Your program should finish when the string "END" is entered.
