//    Write a program that reads two integer matrices (2D arrays) from the console and compares them element by element.
//    For better code reusability, you could do the comparison in a method, which returns true if they
//    are equal and false if not.
//    Each matrix definition on the console will contain a line with a positive integer number R – the number of
//    rows in the matrix and C – the number of columns – followed by R lines containing the C numbers, separated
//    by spaces (each line will have an equal amount of numbers.

//    The matrices will have at most 10 rows and at most 10 columns.
//    Print equal if the matrices match, and not equal if they don’t match.
