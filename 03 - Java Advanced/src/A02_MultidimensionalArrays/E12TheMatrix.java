public class E12TheMatrix {
//    You are given a matrix (2D array) of lowercase alphanumeric characters (a-z, 0-9), a starting position –
//    defined by a start row startRow and a start column startCol – and a filling symbol fillChar. Let’s call the
//    symbol originally at startRow and startCol the startChar. Write a program, which, starting from the symbol
//    at startRow and startCol, changes to fillChar every symbol in the matrix which:
//•	is equal to startChar AND
//•	can be reached from startChar by going up (row – 1), down (row + 1), left (col – 1) and right (col + 1) and
// “stepping” ONLY on symbols equal startChar

//    So, you basically start from startRow and startCol and can move either by changing the row OR column
//    (not both at once, i.e. you can’t go diagonally) by 1, and can only go to positions which have the
//    startChar written on them. Once you find all those positions, you change them to fillChar.
//    In other words, you need to implement something like the Fill tool in MS Paint, but for a 2D char
//    array instead of a bitmap.
