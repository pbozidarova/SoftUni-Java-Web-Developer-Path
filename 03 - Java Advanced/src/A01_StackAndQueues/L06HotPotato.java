//    Hot potato is a game in which children form a circle and start passing a hot potato. The counting starts
//    with the fist kid. Every nth toss the child left with the potato leaves the game. When a kid leaves the game,
//    it passes the potato forward. This continues repeating until there is only one kid left.
//    Create a program that simulates the game of Hot Potato.  Print every kid that is removed from the circle.
//    In the end, print the kid that is left last.
