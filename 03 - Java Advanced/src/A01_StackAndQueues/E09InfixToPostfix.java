//    Mathematical expressions are written in an infix notations, for example "5 / ( 3 + 2 )". However, this kind of
//    notation is not efficient for computer processing, as you first need to evaluate the expression inside the
//    brackets, so there is a lot of back and forth movement. A more suitable approach is to convert it in the
//    so-called postfix notations (also called Reverse Polish Notation), in which the expression is evaluated
//    from left to right, for example "3 2 + 5 /".
//    Implement an algorithm that converts the mathematical expression from infix notation into a postfix notation.
//    Use the famous Shunting-yard algorithm.
