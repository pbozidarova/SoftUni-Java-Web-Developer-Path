//    Given a sequence consisting of parentheses, determine whether the expression is balanced.
//    A sequence of parentheses is balanced if every open parenthesis can be paired uniquely with a
//    closed parenthesis that occurs after the former. Also, the interval between them must be balanced.
//    You will be given three types of parentheses: (, {, and [.
//        {[()]} - This is a balanced parenthesis.
//        {[(])} - This is not a balanced parenthesis.
