//    You are a young and talented developer. The first task you need to do is to implement a filtering module to a
//    party reservation software. First, The Party Reservation Filter Module (TPRF Module for short) is passed a list
//    with invitations. Next the TPRF receives a sequence of commands that specify if you need to add or remove a given
//    filter.
//    TPRF Commands are in the given format {command;filter type;filter parameter}
//    You can receive the following TPRF commands: "Add filter", "Remove filter" or "Print". The possible TPRF filter
//    types are: "Starts with", "Ends with", "Length" and "Contains". All TPRF filter parameters will be a string
//    (or an integer for the length filter).
//    The input will end with a "Print" command. See the examples below:
